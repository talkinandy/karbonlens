title: Verra scraper — fetch, parse, and upsert Indonesian VCS projects
phase: 2
status: draft

blocks: [T07, T09, T11, T12, T13, T19, T21]
owner: spec-writer agent

## 1. User story

As an operator of KarbonLens, I want a weekly Python scraper that fetches all Indonesian VCS projects from the Verra registry, parses their metadata and issuance history, resolves entities against the existing database, and upserts the results into `projects`, `registries`, and `issuances`, so that Phase 3 frontend stories have real carbon project data to display.

---

## 2. Context & rationale

Phase 1 created the schema (T02) and the Next.js scaffold (T03–T05). The database has all 15 tables but zero application data. This story is the first and most foundational data pipeline: every downstream story — maps (T13), scores (T09), alerts (T07), project explorer (T11), and project detail (T12) — depend on the rows written here.

Verra publishes no public API. The registry at `registry.verra.org` is a standard HTML application. Scraping the search page (filtered by Indonesia) and each project's detail page is the only path to structured data.

The implementer should read `docs/architecture.md` §4 (scraper patterns) and `docs/scraper-patterns.md` (produced by this story) before writing a line of code. All conventions there are hard requirements, not suggestions.

Key constraints carried forward from Phase 1:
- Target host: Hetzner CX32 VPS, Python 3.12 already installed, `uv` already installed at `/root/.local/bin/uv` (confirmed present — use it; no fallback to plain pip needed).
- `pg_trgm` extension is already enabled by migration 001 (`similarity()` is available).
- No Verra API key required. No secrets for this story.
- No automated tests for v0.1. Acceptance criteria are manual shell + SQL checks only.

---

## 3. Scope

### In scope

#### 3.1 Bootstrap `scrapers/` Python project

Initialize the Python project in `scrapers/`. `uv` is confirmed present on the VPS at `/root/.local/bin/uv`; use it exclusively. Do not fall back to `python -m venv`.

```bash
cd scrapers
uv init --no-workspace   # creates pyproject.toml + .python-version
uv add "psycopg[binary]>=3" httpx beautifulsoup4 lxml structlog python-dotenv
uv add --dev ruff
```

`uv` creates `scrapers/.venv/` automatically on first `uv run` or `uv sync`. The venv path `/opt/karbonlens/scrapers/.venv/bin/python` is used by the wrapper script (§3.4).

Commit `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `.python-version`. Add `scrapers/.venv/` to `.gitignore` (root `.gitignore` already likely has `.venv`; confirm).

**`pyproject.toml` must include:**

```toml
[project]
name = "karbonlens-scrapers"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "psycopg[binary]>=3",
    "httpx>=0.27",
    "beautifulsoup4>=4.12",
    "lxml>=5",
    "structlog>=24",
    "python-dotenv>=1",
]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py312"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "UP"]
```

#### 3.2 `scrapers/common/` helpers

Create the following files. They are shared by all scrapers (T06, T07, T08, T09).

**`scrapers/common/__init__.py`** — empty.

**`scrapers/common/config.py`**

Loads environment from `.env` and `.env.local` using `python-dotenv`. Exposes:
- `DATABASE_URL: str` — raises `RuntimeError` if absent.
- `SCRAPER_USER_AGENT: str` — defaults to `"KarbonLens/0.1 (+https://karbonlens.id)"` if env var unset (matches `docs/architecture.md` §7).
- `SCRAPER_LOG_DIR: str` — defaults to `/var/log/karbonlens`.

```python
# scrapers/common/config.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv(".env.local", override=True)
load_dotenv(".env", override=False)

DATABASE_URL: str = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL") or _raise("DATABASE_URL is required")
SCRAPER_USER_AGENT: str = os.environ.get(
    "SCRAPER_USER_AGENT", "KarbonLens/0.1 (+https://karbonlens.id)"
)
SCRAPER_LOG_DIR: str = os.environ.get("SCRAPER_LOG_DIR", "/var/log/karbonlens")

def _raise(msg: str) -> str:
    raise RuntimeError(msg)
```

**`scrapers/common/db.py`**

Provides a context manager that yields a psycopg connection with autocommit disabled (use explicit transactions). Reads `DATABASE_URL` from `config.py`.

Exposes:
- `get_connection()` — context manager returning `psycopg.Connection`. Caller is responsible for `conn.commit()` / `conn.rollback()`.
- `execute(conn, sql, params=None)` — thin wrapper calling `conn.execute()` that logs the SQL at DEBUG level before execution.

```python
# scrapers/common/db.py
from contextlib import contextmanager
import psycopg
from .config import DATABASE_URL

@contextmanager
def get_connection():
    with psycopg.connect(DATABASE_URL) as conn:
        yield conn
```

Do not use a module-level singleton connection. Each scraper run should open and close one connection.

**`scrapers/common/logging.py`**

Configures `structlog` with a JSON renderer. Must be called once at the top of each scraper entry point via `configure_logging()`.

Exposes:
- `configure_logging(scraper_name: str) -> None` — configures structlog with `JSONRenderer`, ISO timestamps, and a bound `scraper` key.
- `get_logger(name: str)` — returns a bound structlog logger. Alias for `structlog.get_logger(name)`.

The final JSON line per scraper run must include at minimum:
```json
{
  "scraper": "verra",
  "started_at": "...",
  "finished_at": "...",
  "status": "ok|error",
  "records_in": 42,
  "records_inserted": 10,
  "records_updated": 32,
  "errors": []
}
```

**`scrapers/common/scraper_runs.py`** — create the file but leave it as a stub with a `# TODO: T-later — persist run metadata to scraper_runs table` comment. Do not implement in T06.

#### 3.3 `scrapers/verra/` — core scraper

Create `scrapers/verra/__init__.py` (empty) and the files below.

---

**`scrapers/verra/known_centroids.py`**

A static Python dict of hand-curated centroids for flagship Indonesian carbon projects. These are v0.1 proxies sourced from public project design documents; they will be superseded by digitized polygons in v0.2.

```python
# scrapers/verra/known_centroids.py
# Hand-curated project centroids (lat, lon) for flagship Indonesian VCS projects.
# Source: project design documents, public satellite imagery references, REDD+ project pages.

}

# Province-level fallback centroids (used when no project-specific entry exists).

}
```

> **Open question OQ-1:** Andy to confirm or amend this list of flagship VCS IDs and their centroids before implementation. The list above is a best-effort v0.1 seed. See §9.

---

**`scrapers/verra/fetch.py`** — entry point

Module entrypoint: `python -m scrapers.verra.fetch`

```
Usage: python -m scrapers.verra.fetch [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--dry-run] [--limit N]

  --since   Only process projects whose last_synced_at is older than this date.
            Defaults to processing all (weekly full refresh).
  --dry-run Parse and log candidate rows; write nothing to the DB.
  --limit N Process at most N projects (useful for smoke testing).
```

**High-level execution flow:**

```
1. configure_logging("verra")
2. Parse CLI flags
3. Open DB connection (skip if --dry-run)
4. Fetch project list page → parse project IDs + list-level fields
5. For each project_id (respecting --limit):
   a. Fetch detail page (3-second delay between fetches)
   b. Parse detail fields
   c. Resolve centroid (known_centroids.py → province fallback → NULL)
   d. Entity-resolve against projects table
   e. Upsert project, registry, issuances (skip if --dry-run)
   f. Log one JSON line per project
6. Log final summary JSON line
7. Exit 0 on success, 1 on any unhandled exception
```

**URL constants** (place near top of file, above imports):

```python
# Verra registry search page — Indonesia filter.
# WARNING: Verra's site structure changes without notice. If this URL stops
# returning results, inspect the live page at registry.verra.org and update
# the URL and CSS selectors below accordingly.
VERRA_SEARCH_URL = (
    "https://registry.verra.org/app/search/VCS/Registered+project"
    "?filter%5BcountryCode%5D=ID"
)

# Verra project detail page (append project's numeric ID)
VERRA_DETAIL_BASE = "https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/"

# Verra issuance table endpoint (append project's numeric ID)
VERRA_ISSUANCE_BASE = "https://registry.verra.org/app/issuanceDetail/VCS/"
```

**Fetch layer** (`httpx` with headers):

```python
HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": config.SCRAPER_USER_AGENT,
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
}

FETCH_DELAY_SECONDS = 3          # between each detail-page fetch
RETRY_MAX = 3
RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE = 5           # seconds; doubles on each retry (5, 10, 20)
```

Implement a `_fetch(url: str, *, retries: int = RETRY_MAX) -> str` helper:
- On `httpx.TimeoutException` or 5xx response: wait `RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE * 2^attempt` seconds, retry.
- After all retries exhausted: log error, return `None`.
- Caller checks for `None` and skips the project.

**Parsing — project list page:**

Use `beautifulsoup4` with the `lxml` parser. Parse the results table (`<table class="...">` — actual class name TBD by implementer from live inspection). For each row extract:
- `vcs_id` (e.g. `VCS1477`) — also used to construct the detail URL
- `name` (raw string from the table cell)
- `status` text (e.g. "Registered", "Under Development", "On Hold", "Withdrawn")
- `methodology` (e.g. "VM0007")
- `project_type` (e.g. "AFOLU")
- `country` (should be "Indonesia" — verify; skip if not)

Store raw HTML of each page in a local variable for error reporting. If BeautifulSoup cannot find the expected table structure, log `{"event": "parse_error", "url": url, "html_snippet": html[:2000]}` and return an empty list.

**Parsing — project detail page:**

For each project, fetch `VERRA_DETAIL_BASE + numeric_id`. Extract:
- `developer` (project proponent)
- `hectares` (project area in ha — may be labelled "Total Area")
- `validation_date` (parse to `datetime.date`)
- `first_issuance_date` (from issuance history if not shown on detail)
- `total_vcus_issued` (cumulative VCUs issued)
- `total_vcus_retired` (cumulative VCUs retired)
- `description` (project overview paragraph, first 500 chars)

Also attempt to fetch `VERRA_ISSUANCE_BASE + numeric_id` to get the issuance table (vintage year, credits issued, issuance date, serial range). Parse each row into an `Issuance` dataclass.

If any field is missing or unparseable, set it to `None` (never crash the whole run on a single bad field). Preserve the raw HTML in `raw_metadata` for replay.

**Status mapping:**

| Verra status text | DB `projects.status` |
|---|---|
| `Registered` | `active` |
| `Under Development` | `pipeline` |
| `On Hold` | `suspended` |
| `Inactive` | `suspended` |
| `Withdrawn` | `flagged` |
| anything else | `suspended` (log a warning) |

**Centroid resolution** (in priority order):

1. Check `known_centroids.KNOWN_CENTROIDS[vcs_id]` — use if present.
2. If province is parseable from the detail page, look up `known_centroids.PROVINCE_CENTROIDS[province]`.
3. Otherwise set `centroid = None`. Project is still inserted. T07 will skip centroid-null projects.

**Slug generation:**

```python
import re, unicodedata

def slugify(text: str) -> str:
    text = unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", text).encode("ascii", "ignore").decode()
    text = text.lower().strip()
    text = re.sub(r"[^\w\s-]", "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"[\s_-]+", "-", text)
    return text[:100]
```

If the generated slug already exists for a different project, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

**Entity resolution:**

Before any insert, query the `projects` table for a fuzzy name match using `pg_trgm`:

```sql
SELECT id, name_canonical, similarity(name_canonical, %(name)s) AS sim
FROM projects
WHERE similarity(name_canonical, %(name)s) > 0.70
ORDER BY sim DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Decision table:

| `sim` value | Action |
|---|---|
| `> 0.95` | Skip insert. Call `_update_project_metadata(existing_id, ...)` to bump `updated_at`, refresh `total_vcus_issued`, `total_vcus_retired`. |
| `0.70 < sim <= 0.95` | Insert a row into `project_match_queue` (`candidate_a_id = existing.id`, `candidate_b_id = NULL` since we haven't inserted the new one yet, `similarity = sim`, `match_reason = 'name_fuzzy'`, `status = 'pending'`). Do NOT insert a new project. Log `{"event": "ambiguous_match", "existing": ..., "candidate": ..., "sim": sim}`. |
| `< 0.70` or no match | Insert new project row. |

This logic runs even on `--dry-run`; in dry-run mode log the decision but skip all DB writes.

**Upsert `registries`:**

```sql
INSERT INTO registries (project_id, registry_name, external_id, status, url, raw_metadata, last_synced_at)
VALUES (%(project_id)s, 'Verra', %(external_id)s, %(status)s, %(url)s, %(raw_metadata)s, NOW())
ON CONFLICT (registry_name, external_id)
DO UPDATE SET
    status         = EXCLUDED.status,
    raw_metadata   = EXCLUDED.raw_metadata,
    last_synced_at = NOW();
```

`raw_metadata` must include at minimum:
```json
{
  "html_snippet": "<first 5000 chars of detail page HTML>",
  "scraped_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "vcs_id": "VCS1477",
  "source_url": "https://..."
}
```

**Upsert `issuances`:**

Issuances dedupe on `(project_id, vintage_year, issuance_date)`. There is no unique constraint on this triple in migration 001; the scraper must check before inserting (or migration 001 may have one by the time T06 is implemented — check `001_init.sql` at implementation time). Preferred pattern:

```sql
INSERT INTO issuances (project_id, registry_name, vintage_year, credits, issuance_date,
                       serial_start, serial_end, raw_payload)
SELECT %(project_id)s, 'Verra', %(vintage_year)s, %(credits)s, %(issuance_date)s,
       %(serial_start)s, %(serial_end)s, %(raw_payload)s
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM issuances
    WHERE project_id = %(project_id)s
      AND vintage_year = %(vintage_year)s
      AND issuance_date = %(issuance_date)s
);
```

Alternatively add a unique index on `(project_id, vintage_year, issuance_date)` and use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Either approach is acceptable; prefer the `WHERE NOT EXISTS` pattern to avoid requiring a schema change.

**Structured logging per project:**

Every project processed emits one log line:
```json
{
  "event": "project_processed",
  "vcs_id": "VCS1477",
  "name": "Katingan Mentaya",
  "action": "inserted|updated|skipped|queued",
  "issuances_written": 12,
  "centroid_source": "known|province|null"
}
```

Final summary line:
```json
{
  "event": "run_complete",
  "scraper": "verra",
  "started_at": "...",
  "finished_at": "...",
  "status": "ok",
  "records_in": 42,
  "records_inserted": 42,
  "records_updated": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

#### 3.5 `docs/scraper-patterns.md`

Create this file if it does not already exist. Its content codifies the conventions from `docs/architecture.md` §4 so future scrapers can reference it as the single source of scraper conventions, without needing to read the full architecture doc. See §6 for the file path; see §5 for the content contract.

### Out of scope (explicit non-goals)

- SRN-PPI scraper (v0.2 backlog)
- Gold Standard Registry (v0.3 backlog)
- Real project polygon digitization (v0.2)
- `gfw_geostore_id` column on `projects` — T07 adds this via migration 002
- GFW alert fetching — T07
- Score computation — T09
- Cron installation — T19
- Entity-resolution admin UI — T21 (this story only populates `project_match_queue`)
- Any frontend changes
- `scraper_runs` table persistence (reserved for a later story; `common/scraper_runs.py` stub only)
- Retirement data scraping (schema exists; Verra retirements are a v0.2 priority)

---

## 4. Acceptance criteria (Gherkin)

**AC-1: Dry-run completes with parsed output, no DB writes**
```
Given the scrapers venv is active and DATABASE_URL is set
When  cd scrapers && python -m scrapers.verra.fetch --dry-run --limit 3
Then  the process exits with code 0
And   stdout/stderr contains a JSON log line with "records_in": 3
And   no rows are added to projects, registries, or issuances
```

**AC-2: Full run populates projects table**
```
Given an empty database (first run after T02 migration)
When  python -m scrapers.verra.fetch
Then  the process exits with code 0
And   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE country='ID'; returns >= 30
```

**AC-3: Full run populates registries table**
```
Given AC-2 has completed
When  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM registries WHERE registry_name='Verra';
Then  the result is >= 30
And   every row has a non-null external_id matching 'VCS\d+' pattern
```

**AC-4: Full run populates issuances table**
```
Given AC-2 has completed
When  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issuances;
Then  the result is >= 50
(Verra projects have multi-vintage issuance histories; 50 is a conservative floor)
```

**AC-5: Idempotency — second run creates no duplicates**
```
Given AC-2 has completed (first run counts recorded)
When  python -m scrapers.verra.fetch is run a second time on the same day
Then  project, registry, and issuance counts are unchanged
And   only updated_at / last_synced_at timestamps have advanced
And   the final log line shows "records_inserted": 0 and "records_updated": > 0
```

**AC-6: Katingan Peatland flagship data**
```
Given AC-2 has completed
When  SELECT name_canonical, developer, hectares, validation_date, total_vcus_issued
      FROM projects
      WHERE slug LIKE '%katingan%' OR name_canonical ILIKE '%katingan%';
Then  a row is returned with:
      - hectares approximately 149,800 (within ±5% of Verra's published figure)
      - developer containing 'Rimba Makmur' or 'PT RMU' or 'Wet Tropics'
      - validation_date between 2013-01-01 and 2015-12-31
      - total_vcus_issued > 0
```

**AC-7: project_match_queue is empty on first clean fill**
```
Given AC-2 has completed (first run against an empty database)
When  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM project_match_queue WHERE status='pending';
Then  the result is 0
(No ambiguous duplicates expected on first fill of an empty database;
 any non-zero result indicates a logic bug in entity resolution)
```

**AC-8: Per-project structured log output**
```
Given python -m scrapers.verra.fetch is run with stdout captured
When  the output is inspected
Then  each line is valid JSON
And   at least one line contains "event": "project_processed" with vcs_id, action, and centroid_source
And   the final line contains "event": "run_complete" with scraper, status, records_in,
      records_inserted, records_updated, and errors fields
```

**AC-9: ruff lint passes**
```
Given the scrapers/ directory is populated
When  ruff check scrapers/
Then  exit code is 0 with 0 errors reported
```

## 5. Inputs & outputs

**Inputs:**
- `DATABASE_URL` env var (required; scraper raises `RuntimeError` if absent)
- `SCRAPER_USER_AGENT` env var (optional; defaults to `KarbonLens/0.1 (+https://karbonlens.id)`)
- Verra public HTML at `registry.verra.org` (no credentials required)
- `.env` or `.env.local` in the working directory (loaded by `common/config.py`)

**Outputs:**
- Rows written to `projects` (country `ID`), `registries` (registry_name `Verra`), `issuances`
- Rows optionally written to `project_match_queue` (ambiguous entity matches)
- Structured JSON log appended to `/var/log/karbonlens/verra.log` when run via the wrapper script; to stdout when run interactively
- `scrapers/pyproject.toml`, `scrapers/uv.lock`, `scrapers/.python-version` (Python project metadata, committed to git)
- No secrets written anywhere; no files in `legacy/` modified

**Env vars added to `.env.example`** (if not already present):
```bash
# Scraper config — used by all Python scrapers
SCRAPER_USER_AGENT="KarbonLens/0.1 (+https://karbonlens.id)"
SCRAPER_LOG_DIR=/var/log/karbonlens
```

---

## 6. Dependencies & interactions

**Blocked by:**
- T02 (schema migration 001) — `projects`, `registries`, `issuances`, and `project_match_queue` tables must exist; `pg_trgm` extension must be enabled. Both confirmed done as of 2026-04-21.

**Blocks:**
- T07 — GFW scraper needs `projects` rows with non-null `centroid` to build geostores
- T09 — Score computation needs `projects` and `issuances` rows
- T11 — Projects explorer needs `projects` rows
- T12 — Project detail needs `projects`, `registries`, and `issuances` rows
- T13 — Map integration needs project `centroid` populated
- T19 — Cron installation needs `scrapers/scripts/run_weekly_verra.sh` to exist
- T21 — Entity resolution admin page needs `project_match_queue` rows to review

## 7. Edge cases & failure modes

**E1: Verra HTML structure changes mid-scrape**
The scraper must not crash the entire run when a single project's detail page has an unexpected structure. Pattern: wrap each project's parsing in a `try/except Exception`, log `{"event": "parse_error", "vcs_id": ..., "html_snippet": html[:2000], "error": str(e)}`, and continue to the next project. The raw HTML snippet goes into `raw_metadata.html_snippet` on the registry row if a partial upsert was possible; otherwise it goes only to the log.

**E2: Indonesia filter returns more than 60 projects**
Do not cap. The `--limit` flag exists for smoke testing only. Production runs always ingest the full result set regardless of count.

**E3: Same VCS ID from a prior incomplete run**
The `ON CONFLICT` upsert on `registries(registry_name, external_id)` handles this cleanly. For `projects`, the entity-resolution query will find the existing row with `sim > 0.95` and update metadata instead of inserting a duplicate.

**E4: Projects without a valid centroid**
Insert with `centroid = NULL`. The `centroid` column has no `NOT NULL` constraint. Log `{"event": "project_processed", "centroid_source": "null"}`. T07 skips these projects (its loop filters `WHERE centroid IS NOT NULL`).

**E5: Connection timeout to Verra**
The `_fetch()` helper retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s). After all retries are exhausted, log the failure at WARNING level and return `None`. The caller skips the project and continues the run. The final summary line accumulates failed projects in the `errors` array.

**E6: DB constraint violation (FK or unique)**
Wrap each DB write in a `try/except psycopg.errors.UniqueViolation` (and a broader `psycopg.DatabaseError` catch). Log the error and continue; do not crash the run. The final `errors` array captures all DB errors.

**E7: PostGIS extension absent**
If the DB does not have PostGIS installed, `ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(...), 4326)` will raise a `psycopg.DatabaseError`. The scraper should catch this on the first centroid insert, log a clear `FATAL: PostGIS extension not available — centroid inserts will fail` message, and fall back to inserting `centroid = NULL` for the rest of the run. (This should not happen on the live box where T01 confirmed PostGIS is installed.)

**E8: Malformed `DATABASE_URL`**
`common/config.py` raises `RuntimeError` at import time if the variable is absent. A bad but present URL will cause psycopg to raise `psycopg.OperationalError` on connection open; this propagates as an unhandled exception, the scraper exits with code 1, and the shell wrapper logs the failure.

**E9: `project_match_queue` non-zero on first run**
If AC-7 fails (non-zero pending queue on first fill), it indicates a bug in the similarity threshold logic. The implementer should add a debug log that prints the actual similarity score for every match candidate so the threshold can be tuned. Do not raise the 0.70 floor above 0.95 to mask the issue.

## 9. Open questions

**OQ-1 (blocking for known_centroids.py):** The list of flagship VCS projects in `known_centroids.KNOWN_CENTROIDS` is currently seeded with these 10 projects (Katingan/VCS1477, Rimba Raya/VCS612, Merang Peatland/VCS1350, Sumatera Merang/VCS944, Cendrawasih Aru/VCS2562, Berau Forest Carbon/VCS1764, and four others — see `known_centroids.py` spec above). Andy should confirm or replace this list, and verify the VCS IDs and approximate centroid coordinates, from his domain expertise and any project documents he has access to. The implementer should treat the spec list as a placeholder and not spend time verifying coordinates independently.

**OQ-2 (non-blocking):** Andy's preference for scraper user-agent string on Verra requests. The architecture doc §7 already specifies `"KarbonLens/0.1 (+https://karbonlens.id)"`. If Andy wants a different polite UA (e.g. including a contact email), update `SCRAPER_USER_AGENT` in `.env.example` before deployment. The spec defaults to the value already in the architecture doc.

**OQ-3 (non-blocking):** Whether a unique index on `issuances(project_id, vintage_year, issuance_date)` should be added to migration 001 (or a new migration 001b). Adding it enables a cleaner `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` pattern instead of the `WHERE NOT EXISTS` subquery approach. Since migration 001 is already applied to the live DB, this would require a new `002_` migration or an `ALTER TABLE` addendum. Andy to decide whether to amend migration 001 (requires re-applying on the VPS) or tolerate the `WHERE NOT EXISTS` approach for v0.1.

### Appendix A — `docs/scraper-patterns.md` content contract

The file `docs/scraper-patterns.md` created by this story must cover the following six conventions (derived verbatim from `docs/architecture.md` §4). Future scraper stories (T07, T08, T09) will reference this file, not the architecture doc, for scraper conventions.

1. **Idempotence** — Use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` or `WHERE NOT EXISTS` patterns. A scraper must be safely re-runnable on any day without duplicating data.

2. **Raw payload preservation** — Always store the unprocessed response (JSON, HTML text, PDF text) in a `raw_payload` or `raw_metadata` JSONB column. When the normalized schema evolves, historical data can be re-parsed without re-fetching.

3. **Structured logging** — Use `structlog` with the JSON renderer configured in `common/logging.py`. Every scraper run must emit a final summary JSON line with: `scraper`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `status`, `records_in`, `records_inserted`, `records_updated`, `errors`.

4. **Fail loudly on unrecoverable errors** — On an unhandled exception, log the full traceback and exit non-zero. Cron captures the exit code. Per-record errors (broken HTML, FK violation) are caught, logged, and accumulated in `errors[]`; they do not halt the run but they do appear in the summary line.

5. **Respectful pacing** — Verra detail pages: 3 seconds between fetches. GFW API: 1 request/second. IDXCarbon site: 1 request per 5 seconds. Never parallelize fetches from a single source without explicit rate-limit confirmation.

6. **Entry-point convention** — Every scraper exposes `python -m scrapers.<source>.fetch` with optional flags `--since YYYY-MM-DD`, `--dry-run`, `--limit N`. The `--dry-run` flag must suppress all DB writes while still exercising the full parse path.
